The game is a basic game of pacman, where you need to feed your pacman charcater as much as you can (because winter is coming).
This is not an easy mission! you need to do it when the clock is ticking and some hungry and angry
monsters chasing you and want to eat you alive, so be aware! - because the night is dark and full of terrors.

To success this almost impossible mission the legandary delevopers added 2 funcionalities to help you:
1. You can get more lives in the game - a red heart that appears and disappear in random places on the board.
	Try eat for getting extra live!
2. You can get more time to complete your mission - an hourglass will appear and disappear. 
	If you succeess eating the hour glass - you will get extra 10 seconds for the mission.
